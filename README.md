# Usage

This repository is divided in four parts, `adaptation`, `embedding analysis`, `train`, and `analysis`.

Each part is implemented and documented in the respective folder of this repository.

* The *Adaptation* part constains the code to reproduce the adaptation of english LLMs on a given tokenizer.
* The *Embedding Analysis* part contains the script used to analyze the embedding structure of the adapted models.
* The *Train* folder contains the code and the reference for the library used to train adapted models.
* The *Evaluation* folder contains the code and the reference of the dataset and libraries used to evaluate adapted models during the further stage of training.
